CTY shares with its parent organization, the Johns Hopkins University, a three part mission of teaching, research and service. The Research and Evaluation Department leads, facilitates, and supports efforts across the organization to develop and carry out a systematic research and evaluation agenda for CTY. CTY’s research and evaluation efforts build on the legacy and prodigious work in this area of Dr. Julian Stanley.

Research projects and activities fall into four broad categories:The reliability and factor structure of the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (MPS) was examined, using a sample of 278 college students with more typical academic abilities than that of Frost et al.’s original all-female sample from an elite university. Significant differences were found on the overall MPS score as well as on six of the seven sub scales between the present sample and that of Frost et al. No gender differences were found for any of the MPS scores. Internal reliability was .88 for the total score, with subtests ranging from .57 to .95. Inter-score correlations were relatively consistent with the Frost et al. sample except for a negative correlation between the Personal Standards sub scale and the total score. The factor structure and construct validity were confirmed. Overall, results support the use of the MPS to measure the construct of perfectionism.
Parker, W. D., & Mills, C. J. (1998). An examination of the Murphy-Meisgeier Type Indicator for Children with a sample of academically talented children. Journal of Psychological Type, 44, 20-25.
The equivalence of scores on the Murphy-Meisgeier Type Indicator for Children (MMTIC) and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) was investigated with a sample of 152 academically talented fifth through seventh graders. Although the MMTIC’s internal re liability was acceptably high, alternate forms reliability between the MMTIC and MBTI was not. Concordance of type classification was disappointing, and the MMTIC’s classification errors were systematic rather than random.
Parker, W. D., & Stumpf, H. (1995). An examination of the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale with a sample of academically talented youth. Journal of Psychoeducational Assessment, 13, 372-383.
The reliability, construct validity, and concurrent validity of the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (MPS) was examined with 855 academically talented 6th graders. The internal consistency of the MPS total score was .87; coefficient alphas for the sub scales ranged from .67 to .90. A familyirmatory item factor analysis demonstrated an acceptable degree of fit. A factor analysis of raw scores on the MPS sub scales yielded two factors. The first factor appears to represent dysfunctional perfectionism, while the second reflects healthy perfectionism. Scores on these factors were correlated with the five-factor domain scores obtained on the NEO Five-Factor Inventory.
