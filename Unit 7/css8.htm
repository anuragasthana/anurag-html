<h1>The h1 element is blue.</h1>
<h2>The h2 element is blue too.</h2>
<p>The paragraph element is blue again.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.jhu.edu">link</a> shows the effect of rule with the compound selectors p and a.</p>

A <a href="http://www.weather.com">link</a> that isn't within the paragraph tags does not have that effect.

<div><p>This is green because compound selectors style rules are more specific than the simple style rules.</p></div>

<h3>Some h3 heading.</h3>
<p>The paragraph text after an h3 element is aligned center.</p>
<p>But this paragraph is not affected by the adjacent selectors style rule.</p>

<h1 class="arialbolditalic">The h1 tag with the arialbolditalic style.</h1>
<h3 class="arialbolditalic">The h3 tag with the arialbolditalic style.</h3>
